# Boids_GL
WIP of a boids simulation in C++ with OpenGL 4.6
In its current state this project needs a lot of cleanup and maintenance, but for now this work is suspended indefinitely as I am learning Vulkan.

Recorded Demo of this project available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl3jgAHwCHM

Created with C++ and OpenGL 4.6.
Demo Features:
- Boids Algorithm
- Blinn-Phong Lighting Model
- Directional Realtime Shadows (small calculation issues due to lack of detail in shadow texture)
- Bloom post processing
- AABB Bounding Box test collisions
- Static Uniform Grid
